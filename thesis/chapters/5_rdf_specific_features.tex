\chapter{Using RDF-specific Features}\label{ch:rdfSpecificFeatures}

GRP is a compressor made for all kinds of graphs. This also means that it is not specially adapted for RDF. It is therefore possible to use some special features of RDF to achieve a better compression ratio. This is what chapter~\ref{sec:ontKnowledge} will deal with.

On the other hand, chapter~\ref{ch:GRPvsHDT} already revealed that most of the compressed size is determined by the dictionary, since saving the dictionary is more complex than saving the graph structure. Chapter~\ref{sec:dictFeatures} will therefore focus on how to compress the dictionary even more.
