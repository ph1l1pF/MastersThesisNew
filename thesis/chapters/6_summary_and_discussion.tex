\chapter{Summary and Future Work}\label{ch:summary_and_discussion}

This last chapter concludes the thesis by firstly summarizing its most important results in a compact form and secondly,  discussing what future work might be interesting to do in the area of RDF compression.

\section{Summary}

Due to the constantly growing size of the Semantic Web, scalability problems can occur in terms of storage, transmission and consumption of knowledge graphs. At this point, compression can help by reducing the size of the graphs. The focus of this thesis was on storage and transfer, since grammar-based compression, which was considered here, is best suited for these use cases. 

The first part of the thesis was to compare GRP with HDT. \todo{summary}

\section{Future Work}

The topic of RDF compression covered in this thesis can be divided into two aspects: Graph and dictionary compression. Therefore, these aspects are presented separately in the following list:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Graph Compression
	\begin{description}
		\item [- More sophisticated implementation of GRP:] The GRP implementation used in the thesis is only a proof of concept, i.e., it is not performing well in terms of its run time. Also, the whole graph has to be loaded into the main memory. A faster and more space-efficient variant is needed in order to compete with the more mature HDT.
		\item [- Node-based compression:] GRP is an edge-based compressor, which means that it replaces edges of a graph by non terminal edges. However, there are also grammar-based compressors which are edge- and node-based, thus also replacing nodes by non terminal nodes. It would be interesting to see whether they can outperform GRP for RDF graphs. Currently, such a compressor is under development as an extension of~\cite{mattdk}.
		\item [- Better grammar encoding:] In Ch.~\ref{sec:related_workGrammarEncoding}, it has already been stated that the grammar encoding method of GRP is not always working well (especially the $k^2$-tree for storing the start rule). Therefore, a different method can be chosen which maybe delivers better results.
		\item [- Compress multiple graphs together:] As already mentioned in Ch.~\ref{sec:approachEqualProperties}, it is possible to compress multiple graphs at once. Then, properties or entities can be replaced by equal properties or entities, respectively. This would enable $Graph_{GRP}$ to produce a better compression.
	\end{description}
	\item Dictionary Compression
	\begin{description}
		\item [- More compression methods for literals:] As explained in Ch.~\ref{sec:approachLiterals}, the thesis focused on string compression via Huffman Coding. But in literals there can be many other data types. It would be sensible to have a separate compression technique for each of those data types. That would probably result in a better compression ratio.

\end{itemize}
